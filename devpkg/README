USAGE: ./devpkg {[-S | -L] NULL } {[-F | -B | -I] url [-c configure_opts | 
				-m make_opts | -i install_opts]}

DevPkg is a simple package manager developed as a part of "Learn C the Hard Way" 
course by Zed Shaw. It's primary purpose is to fetch and install packages from 
source, either in form of tarballs or git repos. 
DevPkg accepts the following parameters:
	-S : initialize the packages database kept in /usr/local/.devpkg/db. It also
		 requires a mandatory dummy parameter, like -S NULL, to function properly.
	-L : list all the database entries, effectively displaying the list of software
		 installed by DevPkg. The dummy parameter applies here as well, use -F NULL.
	-F : recursivey solves all dependencies stored in /tmp/DEPENDS file, installing 
		 the required packages, then fetches the source from the given url, stores 
		 it in /tmp/pkg-src and untars (if applicable) to /tmp/pkg-build.
	-B : fetches the package from the given url and runs ./configure && make && make 
		 install with the options provided as commandline parameters -c, -m and -i, 
		 respectively. Also updates the database, adding the record of software installed.
	-I : performs a check to determine whether the software by the given url has already
		 been installed, and if not, fetches its source and builds it similar to -B option.
		 The difference is in performing cleanup after installation. The recommended way
		 of installing packages.

EXAMPLES:
	Installing TOR:
		./devpkg -S NULL
		./devpkg -I https://dist.torproject.org/tor-0.2.4.23.tar.gz
